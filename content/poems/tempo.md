A patchy sod with grass and wild floret \
Blue current spirals merging rocks and sand \
White smokes and droplets dawn the valleyed land \
Three puffs to lace the hazy mind forget

Cartwheel through time rolls back the wood roulette \
Sweet martingale each step we take is grand \
Through canyoned hills we surf yet where we strand \
In shrouded waves we rest with teared duvet

Between the steep ravine swirls gleamy stream \
Convening streams the withered fish shall spring

Under the dirge washed earth we search the verse \
To cry the spell, entomb the doom that looms \
In glassy mist the thirsted birch unearth \
With doomy gloom the fumy shrooms abloom
