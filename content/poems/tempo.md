A patchy sod with <span style="color: #4CAF50">grass</span> and wild floret \
<span style="color: #42a5f5">Blue</span> current spirals merging rocks and sand \
<span style="color: #e8e8e8">White</span> smokes and droplets dawn the valleyed land \
Three puffs to lace the hazy mind forget

Cartwheel through time rolls back the <span style="color: #A0522D">wood</span> roulette \
Sweet martingale each step we take is grand \
Through canyoned hills we surf yet where we strand \
In shrouded <span style="color: #5dade2">waves</span> we rest with teared duvet

Between the steep ravine swirls <span style="color: #FFD700">gleamy</span> stream \
Convening streams the withered fish shall <span style="color: #66BB6A">spring</span>

Under the dirge washed <span style="color: #b8860b">earth</span> we search the verse \
To cry the spell, entomb the <span style="color: #e53935">doom</span> that looms \
In glassy mist the thirsted <span style="color: #D2B48C">birch</span> unearth \
With doomy gloom the fumy <span style="color: #9C27B0">shrooms</span> abloom
